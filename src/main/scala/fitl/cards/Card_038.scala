// Single Event Text
// Fortification mentality: Redeploy all COIN forces outside Vietnam to
// COIN-Controlled Cities. ARVN Resources â€“12. No Infiltrate or Trail
// Improvement by Rally until Coup.
// MOMENTUM
//
// Tips
// "Outside Vietnam" means Laos and Cambodia Provinces. The executing Faction
// gets to choose which redeploying pieces go to which COIN-Controlled Cities (5.1).
// Redeploy and Resource drop occur instantly and once; the effects on Infiltrate and
// Rally last until the next Coup Round (5.4).
