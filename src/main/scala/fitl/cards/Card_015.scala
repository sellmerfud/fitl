// Unshaded Text
// Dustoff: This Commitment, all Troop Casualties Available (mark).
// MOMENTUM
//
// Shaded Text
// Hueys diverted: Executing Faction remains Eligible. 
// Until Coup, no Air Lift (mark).
// MOMENTUM
//
// Tips
// Place the "Medevac" marker on the corresponding side onto the set-aside
// Momentum card as a reminder of which text was executed. For unshaded, upon
// the coming Commitment Phase, immediately move all US Troops that are in the
// Casualties box to Available; no Troops go out of play; Base Casualties still do.
// The Casualties will already have reduced Aid in the preceding Resources Phase (6.2.5, 6.5).
// If unshaded Event 73 "Great Society" occurs while unshaded "Medevac" is in effect,
// "Medevac" affects the immediate Commitment Phase and then stays in effect to affect
// the coming Coup Roundâ€™s Commitment Phase as well. Note also that unshaded "Medevac"
// played during the final campaign would have no effect unless unshaded "Great Society"
// subsequently occurs, because there otherwise will be no further Commitment Phase (6.4.5, 6.5).
